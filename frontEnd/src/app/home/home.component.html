  <h2>So what kind of articles do we publish?</h2>

  <div class="divPara">
    <p>
      We know it is challenging to cover all the important issues, to invest
      resources in research and disseminate important news quickly and
      accurately – especially for independent reporting trying to overcome the
      right-wing and conservative media paradigm. So all articles published, can
      be republished for free, either translated or in the original language.
      You can use them for commercial and non-commercial purposes. You do not
      need to ask permission from us or provide any credit.
